# Office Warning Light

Hammerspoon configuration script that controls a Yeelight smart LED light bulb in front of my home office door

Light changes color based on various events:

  * Off if Citrix Viewer (work connection) is not running
  * Red if in a Zoom meeting with mute off or video on
  * Yellow if in a Zoom meeting with video off and mute turned on
  * Green if at work but not in a Zoom meeting
